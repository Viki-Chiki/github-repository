1. git init     --> to initiate empty git repository
2. git status   --> to check status  version control system
3. git add      --> to add a file from untracked to staged status
4. git commit -M "message"      --> to save the file on git from staged to tracked status
5. git restore      --> to restore the deleted file
6. git log      --> to check history of changes (commit)


steps I had taken to add repository from vs code to git hub through CLI(command line interface)
1. first check status with git status
    PS E:\github-repository> git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
2. then use command git remote add origin <github_account_link>
3. git remote -v   ---> to verify remote link is added or not 
	it will show same origin url-link for push and fetch
4. git branch   ---> to check the branch name i.e master/main
5. if you have to give access of your github account from the local to repository. you need to configure it with github
   with the hwlp of PAT (personal access token)
6. git remote set-url origin https://PAT_token@github.com/(your github url)
7. git remote -v   ---> to verify the remote

git push origin master      --> to push the updated file to github repository from local file system
git pull origin master      --> to pull the updated from the github repository to local file system

this is some new changes
